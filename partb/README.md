# Overview

This database is a manuscript management system for the Journal of E-commerce Research Knowledge. There are three types of users: author, editor, reviewer.

Our management system consists of:
- `setup.sql` creates the tables, views, triggers, and initial inserts
- `database.py` defines a class to establish the specific database
- `db_driver.py` runs the database management system
- `db_functions.py` specifies all the functionality for commands


# Running the code

Execute `setup.sql` to create the tables, views, triggers, and insert initial data.

To run the front-end application, execute `db_driver.py` by entering the following in the command line:
```
python db_driver.py
```

The system will prompt for a master key, used to encrypt passwords. To avoid using encryption, change the following line in `db_driver.py`
```
db = Database(SERVER, USERNAME, PASSWORD, DATABASE, confidential=True)
```
to read `confidential=False`.

From there, the user may type in an indefinite number of commands, which are explained below. At any point, the user may type 'q' or 'quit' to exit the management system.


# Commands
For all commands, we use the pipe character `|` as the delimiter. The general commands can be executed at any point. The author-, editor-, and reviewer-specific commands can only be executed when a user of that category is logged in.

# Limitations
- The title of a manuscript cannot contain apostrophes or quotations marks ` "
- No inputs can include the pipe character `|`
- The secondary author name cannot include spaces in the first name or last name
- There is no "log out" functionality; an active user is logged out only when a different user is logged in.
- The master key must be entered anew each time the database starts up. For encryption to work properly, the master key ought to be constant each time.
- When a new manuscript is submitted, it is randomly assigned to an avilable editor.
- We have not implemented certain checks of defensive programming, such as ensuring integers are valid.
- Does not accept RICodes outside what was provided by the professor
- To switch users, we must log out
- For extra, inserted data cannot be used


# Extra credit

### Password authentication
Upon starting the system, the user is prompted to enter a master key. This key can be any string.

All newly registered users will be required to enter a password, which is stored in the database under the "credential" table. The passwords are encrypted in the server using `AES_ENCRYPT` and `AES_DECRYPT`. Subsequently, the user will be required to enter their password each time upon logging in.


### Authorization using `GRANT`
Upon registration, a new user is created in the system. The user's name will be Team17_x, where x is the personID of the new user. Several permissions are granted to the user. In the comments are what grant authorization is given for the extra credit, although additional permissions were given in order for the rest of the database front-end to work (ideally, all queries should be rewritten such that it's in line with the grants or makes sense in real life)

Once a user logs into the system, their credentials are inputted into the system, and they will reconnect with the database with their new credentials.

When a reviewer resigns, a randomly generated number will be inputted as a new password, and they will be locked out of the system. All their prior information is preserved.
